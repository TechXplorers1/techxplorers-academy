This isn't just a compliance checkbox; it's a fundamental aspect of good design.\n\n### Core Principles\n\n* **Perceivable:** Users must be able to perceive the information being presented. This means providing text alternatives for images and captions for videos.\n* **Operable:** Users must be able to operate the interface. This includes making sure all functionality is available from a keyboard.\n* **Understandable:** Information and the operation of the user interface must be understandable.\n* **Robust:** Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.",

Understanding these advanced features is what separates a junior developer from a senior one.\n\n### Must-Know Concepts\n\n* **Closures:** A closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function. This is fundamental to concepts like data privacy and callbacks.\n* **Prototypes:** JavaScript is a prototype-based language. Understanding how objects inherit properties from other objects is key to writing efficient and organized code.\n* **Asynchronous JavaScript:** Modern web applications rely heavily on asynchronous operations. Mastering Promises and `async/await` is essential for handling API calls and other operations that take time.",
